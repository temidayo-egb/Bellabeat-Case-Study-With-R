In this project, i work as a data anlyst to Identify potential opportunities for growth and recommendations for the Bellabeat marketing strategy improvement based on trends in smart device usage.

KEY QUESTIONS:

* What are some trends in smart device usage?
* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

SHARE SUMMARY OF THE IMPORTANT FINDINGS FROM ABOVE ANALYSIS:

* We can see that the Average of Total Steps Count is 7600(approx) which is little lower than the average daily steps count preferred by WHO i.e 8000 

Recommendation: Bellabeat can notify its user through their mobile application regarding the remaining daily steps count to complete. The maximum number of users fall into Inactive Category and Bellabeat can focus on these users.

* There is a unique finding from the above analysis, the "TimeToSleep" (attribute which calculate the time difference between Total time in bed and total time asleep) helps to identify that average time interval is 39.31 minutes.

Recommendation: Belabeat can use this data to Monitor the sleep Pattern and can provide suggestion to its Users on "How to improve the sleep Quality?" etc.

* We can see that there exist a positive correlation between the totalsteps~Calories.Its obvious thing that higher the number of TotalSteps, higher will be the calories burned. And this hypothesis is proved by above graph.

* We can clearly distinguish the difference between average Lightly Active Minutes and Fairly/Moderate/Very Active Minutes. The average Sedentary Minutes is also quite high i.e 16hrs(approx) which concludes that most of the users were Lightly Active or Inactive.

* From weekday Steps analysis of different type of users. We found that; 1. The VeryActive Users were more active on Saturday & Sundays. 2.The Active Users were consistent with their step counts through out the week.

* There are less no. of "VeryActiveUsers" as compare to "Active" Users.Inactive Users tends to spend more of their time sleeping which is unhealthy.We can clearly identify the underlying trends in each category of users(Refer to Calories Vs. Sleep Quality By Steps Categories Graph).

* It seems an interesting trend that maximum users tends to take rest on Sundays followed by Wednesdays.Tuesdays,Thursdays & Fridays are quite busy days (Sleep Duration is less on these days)

Recommendation: On busy Days where the sleep duration is below the recommended hours, the bellabeat app can notify users that the amount of Sleep is not sufficient enough and its an unhealthy routine.
